# Identifying important genes using latent space generated by autoencoders
In this project, we are using gene expression data **GSE96058** which has three grades of breast cancer. 

# Design
This repository contains code to create a baseline model of an autoencoder and later add a few layers to generate a more dense form in order to improve the model's performance.

## Dataset 
Please download the dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus by following this GSE ID [GSE96058](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96058).

## Usage
### Major packages required
* tensorflow
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib


### To begin, use the **study workflow** notebook.
* Create the required datasets by executing notebook cells step by step.
* Split datasets in training and testing using the code mentioned in the notebook.
* Run the python scripts to generate variations of autoencoders.
